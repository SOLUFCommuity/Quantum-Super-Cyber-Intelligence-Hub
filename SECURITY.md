# 🛡️ Security Policy: Quantum-Super Intelligence Hub

## ⚠️ Security Clearance Notice
Access to this repository is restricted to authorized entities. By interacting with the Quantum-Super Cyber Intelligence Hub codebase, you agree to adhere to the protocols outlined below.

## 📡 Supported Versions

The following versions of the Hub are currently receiving security synchronization and neural updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 8.6.x   | ✅ Yes (Active)     |
| 8.5.x   | ✅ Yes (Legacy)     |
| < 8.5   | ❌ No              |

## ⚡ Reporting a Vulnerability (Protocol 0xBB)

If you discover a breach in our neural mesh, a logic flaw in the quantum kernel, or a standard application vulnerability, please do not disclose it publicly. Follow the **Silent Echo** protocol:

1.  **Encryption**: Encrypt your report using the Hub's primary 8192-bit key (or a standard PGP key if external).
2.  **Transmission**: Send the payload to `security-ops@quantum-super.null` (Placeholder).
3.  **Containment**: Allow 72 tactical hours for our AI core to analyze the vector and formulate a patch before public disclosure.

### What to Include:
*   **Vector ID**: A brief name for the vulnerability.
*   **Breach Steps**: Detailed instructions to reproduce the anomaly.
*   **Impact Analysis**: What part of the hub is compromised (e.g., AI Command, Threat Map, Q-Diag).

## 🧩 Security Standards

*   **Quantum Integrity**: All data transmission within the hub is simulated to follow QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) standards.
*   **Gemini AI Safety**: The "Core Intelligence" utilizes Google's safest model configurations, ensuring responses remain within tactical and ethical boundaries.
*   **Dependency Audit**: We employ daily automated scans to ensure the bridge between legacy PHP systems and the Python kernel remains untampered.

## 📜 Disclaimer
This system is a **High-Fidelity Cyber Defense Simulation**. While the UI/UX simulates real-world C2 (Command and Control) operations, it is intended for research, training, and visualization. Use in live production environments requires integration with verified enterprise security stacks.
